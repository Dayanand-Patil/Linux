4 x 32 = 128 pins

each pin have 8 multiplexed mode(0-7)

To configure pin as GPIO : mode 7

location : sys/class/gpio/<node_of_gpios>

GPIO0[4] = 0 x 32  + 4 = GPIO4
GPIO1[4] = 1 x 32  + 4 = GPIO36

Register to set the mode (using controle module reg.) 
pin configuration register start addr = base addr of control module register(check into memory map) + offset(0x800)
[mode, pull up/pull down] done by pin conf reg.

pin configuration register start addr : ls /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/<addr>.pinmux
	u can check all pins mode configuration here
u can see the same pin configutation at linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/ location

check the pin functions and group and allocation:: cat pinmux-pins 

how many groups(i2c, emmc, hdmi, lcd) are there in kernel related to pins? :: cat pingroups

play with user LED:
	check the GPIO on which usr led r connected
	ls /sys/class/led/
	perform operation on led: echo '<option>' > trigger	
	show <options> to pass to led: cat trigger

Controlling LED using C usr application
	LED_SYS_PATH 
	snpritf(buf) : concat 2 strings(syspath and led_node) into buf
	fd = open(): open buf 
	write(): write the control value to fd
