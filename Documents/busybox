proj for resume:
Working on busybox to generate minimal rootfs	
customize your file system
generate single executable binary by merging all executables present in /bin & /sbin(i.e ls, pwd)
enabling ethernate over USB functionality 
bring up usb interface during system boot time(load the driver during system start up)
	add 'sbin/modprobe g_ether' sbin/rmmod g_ether in rcs supported files and reboot the kernel 
providing ssh support for system(to change the settings or communicate remotely)



compile busybox
download: https://busybox.net/downloads/
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- defconfig
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- CONFIG_PREFIX=/home/daya/workspace/porting/BBB_rfs_static install -j8
module install (install modules/.ko from linux source to rootfs path) it will create lib/modules directory 


booting linux thr TFTP

images(generated from uboot source) in SD: MLO, uEnv.txt, u-boot.img
uimg(generated from kernel source) at host(pc) tftp: uImage, am335x_boneblack.dtb
rootfs(generated by busybox) at host(pc): copied at boot time thr tftp

insert SD card in BBB -- press S2 switch to boot from  

kernel will boot successfully......
Probelm #1: 
1. init script not found

----loading init program/service from busybox/rootfs --- init programm and runlevel scripts
in rootfs 1st programm launches is 'init'
	
	Linux boot control flow:
--> uboot --> head.S --> main.c --> init

init try to execute the script called 'rcs' from /etc/init.d/
rcs is a script file --> mention the services which u wants to start at kernel init time
