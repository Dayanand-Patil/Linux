//Uboot

If Chipset controller increases form factor increases.If all coontroller is part of SoC then form factor is less
Soc Provides on chip memory controller to to connect ext memory devices
//MPU:
ARM Cortex A8 processor [32 bit RISC processor speed 1GHz]
RAM - 64kb
ROM - 176kb
L1 Instruction cache : 32 kb
L1 Data cache : 32 kb

Interconnect: High speed buses to carry data/info between diffrent controllers and peripherals.
Every interconnect having set of register which used to controle speed and data on buses.

//memory Interfaces:
GPMC [general perpose memory controller] : used to connect NAND/NOR types of flash memory.it used connect static flash memory.
If you want connect DDR2 or 3 dynamic RAM, connection has to go through DDR2/3 controller(EMIF) 

MMC0 interface => SD card (MMC0_DATA0) 16 GB
MMC1 interface => eMMC (MMC1_DATA0) 4 GB
DDR ibterface ==> DDR 512 MB
//eMMC Booting

eMMC : 4 GB
