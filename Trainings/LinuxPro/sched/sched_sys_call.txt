Take a look at the manual pages for the following scheduling related system calls.

    nice() - Change process priority of a normal process (SCHED_OTHER)
    getpriority()/setpriority() - get/set program scheduling priority.
    sched_getscheduler()/sched_setscheduler() - set and get scheduling policy/parameters
    sched_getparam()/sched_setparam() - set and get scheduling parameters
    sched_get_priority_max/min - get static priority range
    sched_rr_get_interval() - get the SCHED_RR interval for the named process

Some of the above APIs also have POSIX equivalents. If you are using pthread APIs, it is recommended that you use the pthread_ variants of these APIs.
