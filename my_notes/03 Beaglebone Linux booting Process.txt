what we need to successfully boot 
SOC am335x, arm cortex a8

PBL from soc loads the SBL/MLO , SBL loads the uboot.img from DDR
uboot loads the kernel , and then rootfs

sbl preset at boot rom (176kb) present inside SOC	

PBL:
	power button pressed board undergoes power on reset and jump to rom init address to start pbl
	__main() - pbl stack initialize
	main() - 
		watchdog timer init (watch for 3 min)
	      -- if pbl failed to load sbl within 3min it will restart soc
		PLL setup for clock configuration(low to high freq conversion) 20Mhz crystal osc produces 500MHz clock through PLL
		in sbl we can configure pll for custom freq as per device req.

SBL:
	check for valid boot image	
	pbl loads MLO from emmc memory into soc internal SRAM (128KB)
	pbl checks MLO's image header and image size to check load addr in SRAM	 
	hence sbl loaded into internal RAM and MLO starts execution
	MLO:
		init UART console to print debug msg
		init DDR register to use ddr memory and load the uboot.img into DDR
		init pin muxing for soc pripheral also init eMMC to DDR pinmux to 
		load uboot image from eMMC to DDR pinmux 
		uboot also consists header[load addr into DDR + size of uboot.img] 				
		
		
Booting of PBL and MLO practically
	SD card: 2 partition
		Partition 1: FAT(for MLO, uboot.img) create partition using gparted give name as BOOT and cp MLO /media/<user>/BOOT/MLO
		partition 2: EXT3/EXT4(rootfs)  create partition using gparted give name as ROOTFS
		
	insert sd card into BBB, connect board to Host PC using USB-UART Cable 
	open minicom; set ttyUSB port and boud rate; 
	power ON the board and press S2 button on board to boot from eMMC 
RootFS: using busybox
	generate rootfs and copy into sd card partition 2	 

uEnv.txt: copy into BOOT partition
	mention path to load the uimage and rootfs	

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Load the image from uboot cmd line
	load mmc 0:2 0x82000000 /media/ROOTFS/uimage
read the uimage header: memory display
	md 0x82000000 10  --> display 10 parameter mem. addr of uimage header
