https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33549211/how-to-add-i2c-devices-on-the-beaglebone-black-using-device-tree-overlays

the device tree compiler compiles (dtc) into device tree blobs (.dtb), a binary format. When the system boots the bootloader (e.g. u-boot) hands over that blob to the kernel. The kernel parses it and creates all the devices as given by the device tree.

create an overlay to configure the GPIO pins for the i2c1 bus
activate that bus , status = "ok"

add rtc device i2c so that approptiate will automaticaly ad the entry at /dev

pin muxing on GPIO pin header p8 and P9
at p9 header pin P9_17(I2C1_SCL) and P9_18(I2C2_SDA) 
To configure this pin as i2c we need to set the GPIO mode 2 (Check the TI manual)


create overlay node:
	to create overlay we have two targets 1. pin mux of am335x 2. i2c node to enable RTC

/* Pin mux of am335x for pin configured as i2c

/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

/{  /* this is device tree overlay not a root node */
	
	compatible = "ti, beaglebone", "ti, beaglebone-black";
	part-number = "BBB-i2c1";
	version = "00A0";

	fragment@0 {	
		target = <&am335x_pinmux>;
		
		__overlay {
			i2c1_pins: pinmux_i2c1_pins{
				pinctrl-single, pins = <
					<pin_offset> <GPIO_config_reg_val> // SCL
					<pin_offset> <GPIO_config_reg_val> //SDA
					>;
				};
			};
		};
	
 
/* add node for RTC */
fragment@1 {  /* RTC node */
	target = <&i2c1>;
	__overlay__ {
		pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_pins>;  //pinctrl handle
		
		clock-frequency = <100000>; //set a I2C clock frequency of 100kHz and activate the device. 
		status = "okey";

	rtc: rtc@68 {  // this rtc defined as child node for i2c1 bus

		compatible = "dallas,ds1307"; //compatible = "manufaturer, rtc_name"  compatible statement, naming the driver to use (ds1307)
		#address cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x68>;  //devices address on the I2C bus (0x68).
		};
	};
    };
}; // root node end
