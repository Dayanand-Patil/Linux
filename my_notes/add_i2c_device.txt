The first step is to detect that the device is present on the bus.
   detect i2c1 bus devices
	i2cdetect ‐y ‐r <i2c_num> (i.e i2cdetect ‐y ‐r 1)
	
   cat modalias ==> shows i2c bus address
When UU is displayed, probing was skipped, as the address is already in use by a driver

read in the values of the registers of the device attached to an I2C bus
	
	i2cdump ‐y <i2c_num> <slave_addr> (i2cdump ‐y 1 0x53)

while reading the gpio kenel panic occurs
1. addr2line --> convert address into function name
2. arm-linux-gnueabi-gdb vmlinux
